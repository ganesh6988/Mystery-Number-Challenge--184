Project Details

Overview:
        The Mystery Number Challenge is a console-based number guessing game implemented in C++. It provides an interactive   experience where players attempt to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The game offers features like multiple difficulty levels, limited attempts per game session, and visual feedback upon winning or losing.

Features and Functionalities:

Gameplay Mechanics:

      Players input their guesses to identify the mystery number.
      Hints are provided based on the proximity of their guesses to the correct number.
      Players have a limited number of attempts per game session (customizable).

Visual Feedback:

      ASCII art is used to visually celebrate a win with sparkles.
      A sad face ASCII art is displayed upon losing the game.

User Interaction:

      Menu-driven interface allows players to start a new game, view the results of the last 3 rounds, or exit the game.
      Results of the last 3 rounds are stored and displayed upon request.


Data Management:

       Uses simple data structures (arrays and vectors) to manage game options and store game history.
       Utilizes basic file handling (not detailed in current implementation) for potential future enhancements like saving       game statistics.

Enhancements and Scalability:

       Designed for easy scalability with potential future enhancements such as saving player statistics, multiplayer mode, or integrating with graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks.



Conclusion
The Mystery Number Challenge project demonstrates foundational skills in C++ programming, game logic implementation, and user interface design within a console environment. It aims to provide an engaging and interactive experience for players while showcasing the capabilities of basic programming constructs and standard C++ libraries.
